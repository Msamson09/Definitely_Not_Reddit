# Definitely Not Reddit

## Getting Started:

[Launch App](https://definitelynotreddit.herokuapp.com/)

I was curious about how social media applications such as Reddit worked, so I decided to do a project similar to that. I quickly learned that it is a lot harder to replicate the styling of those applications. I will continue to work polish and add features.

### Instruction:
- The website will automatically have you login to with Google name and password.  It is required to login to interact with the application.
- Posts can be added by inputing a title and text then pushing create post.
- After a post has been created, the author of the post, and only the author of the post has access to edit or delete the post.
- Anyone logged in can interact with a post by clicking on the title and then choosing to add a reply.  Either the author of the original post or author of the reply can delete a reply.
